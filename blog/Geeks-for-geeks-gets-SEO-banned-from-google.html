               <p>Google’s hammer has struck, and it hit hard… This might be the toughest penalty I’ve ever seen. GeeksForGeeks, once a go-to site for developers, SEOs, and more, has been deindexed by Google. The result? A complete loss of visibility.</p>
               <p>If you search for the site now, you won’t find it. There’s no trace of existence… This sudden drop in visibility is a harsh reminder of how quickly and severely Google can impact even the most established sites. Below is a screenshot of my SERP. GeeksForGeks is gone. Gone with the wind...
               </p>
               <img src="https://misinate.sirv.com/perso/Geeksforgeeks/geeks%20for%20geeks%20-%20Google%20Search.jpeg" width="700" height="800" alt="Google Search for GeeksForGeeks">
               <h2> The SEO crash in numbers</h2>
               <img src="https://misinate.sirv.com/perso/Geeksforgeeks/Screenshot%202025-04-09%20at%205.40.04%E2%80%AFPM.png" width="800" height="400" alt="Semrush screenshot of the SEO downfall of GeeksforGeeks">
               <p>In the first quarter of the year (January to March), GeeksForGeeks saw an impressive 136.9 million visits, per <a href="https://fr.semrush.com">Semrush data.</a> With 83% of that traffic coming from Google. Fast forward to April, and that number drops to zero. No traffic. Nothing.
                  It’s clear: when Google decides to strike, it doesn’t hold back. It’s swift, brutal, and leaves lasting consequences.
               </p>
               <p>I personally find this fascinating. Google does not play. They might grant you the benefit of the doubt, but when they make sure you're trying to play them, they will knock you out.</p>
               <P>What I like to bear in mind is that they did this for GeeksForGeeks and previously <a href="https://youtu.be/RICAs2U_4x4">Forbes</a>. Huge actors in the web scene. Imagine what they would do to sites like yours and mine...</P>
               </p>
               <h2>SEO learnings from GeeksForGeeks</h2>
               <h3>Subdomains: are <i>really</i> subdoamins</h3>
               <p>Google tells us it treats subdomains as separate entities, meaning any issues on a subdomain shouldn’t necessarily affect the main domain. Can we say that's not true in this case ? Geeks For Geeks was deindexed completely. No subdomain was spared.
                  
                  This might be a unique case. But it might not be... We know there have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24167119/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-seo-chrome-clicks">leaks from Google’s 2024 API</a>  suggesting that Google doesn’t always make a clear distinction between a primary domain and its subdomains. So, it’s important to be cautious when dealing with subdomains.
               </p>
               <h3>The Culprit: Topical Drift</h3>
               <p>So, what exactly went wrong with GeeksForGeeks? The main issue appears to be “topical drift” — an issue that many websites face as they try to diversify content. GeeksForGeeks began expanding its focus beyond its core area of expertise in tech and development. They ventured into irrelevant topics such as birthday celebrations and Instagram tips. While diversification is key to growing a site, doing so without a clear strategy or without staying relevant to your core audience dilutes your authority. In this case, GeeksForGeeks shifted too far from its technical roots, weakening its perceived authority in the process.
               </p>
               <h3>Site structure VS Global penalty</h3>
               <P>Another key takeaway is the importance of having a solid site structure. GeeksForGeeks fell victim to this with its flat URL structure. A flat structure means there’s no clear hierarchy for search engines to follow, which can cause confusion and make it harder to prioritize content.
                  This lack of hierarchy could very well be one of the reasons Google imposed a global penalty on the entire site. As an SEO professional, I can’t stress enough how crucial site structure is. Proper structuring can improve crawl efficiency and give your site a much better chance of ranking higher.

               <H2>SEO Takeaways: Lessons Learned from GeeksForGeeks’ Decline</H2>
               <ul>
                  <li>Stay Focused on Your Core Topic: Expanding into new areas is great, but make sure they align with your core expertise. Randomly diversifying content just to capture more clicks or traffic can hurt your authority and affect your overall EEAT (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness).</li>
                  <li>Properly Structure Your URLs: A clean URL structure is essential for SEO. Using subdirectories or subdomains allows you to test new content without risking your entire domain’s rankings.</li>
                  <li>Treat Subdomains with Caution: If you’re planning to experiment with new content or approaches, consider using a completely separate domain. A subdomain is still a part of your main domain, and it can still impact your overall site performance.</li>
                  <li>Don’t Chase Clicks at the Expense of Quality: It’s tempting to expand your content pillars in an effort to capture more search traffic. But remember, quality always trumps quantity. Keep your content focused, relevant, and valuable to your audience.</li>
               </ul>
               <h2>Some thoughts from the Twitter community</h2>
               <p>I went and checked <a href="https://x.com/geeksforgeeks/status/1906951096792433109">the official twitter post from Geeks For Geeks </a>announcing the feud with Google. The community was divised. There were some interesting thoughts to say the least : </p>
               <img src="https://misinate.sirv.com/perso/Geeksforgeeks/Screenshot%202025-04-10%20at%204.12.34%E2%80%AFPM.png" width="500" height="400" alt="Geeks For Geeks Twitter post">               
               <p>Some users were quick to point out that the site had been on a downward spiral for a while. They mentioned that the quality of content had declined, and the site was filled with irrelevant articles. With the usual Twitter politeness... </p>
               <img src="https://misinate.sirv.com/perso/Geeksforgeeks/Screenshot%202025-04-10%20at%204.16.13%E2%80%AFPM.png" width="500" height="400" alt="Twitter user sharing his thoughts on Google banning Geeks for Geeks">
               <p>Others were more sympathetic, suggesting that the site had been a valuable resource for developers and that its loss would be felt across the community. They expressed hope that GeeksForGeeks would be able to recover and return to its former glory.</p>
               <img src="https://misinate.sirv.com/perso/Geeksforgeeks/Screenshot%202025-04-10%20at%204.14.58%E2%80%AFPM.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Twitter user reaction to geeks for geeks ban">
               <h2>Wrapping up on the Geeks For Geeks SEO downfall</h2>
               <p>In conclusion, the GeeksForGeeks case serves as a wake-up call for all websites. SEO is a game of consistency and relevance. While trying to diversify and capture new audiences can be tempting, it’s important to stay true to your niche and maintain a clear, focused approach.
                  The only thing left to do now is wait and see whether the site’s administrators can regain Google’s favor. As of writing this,they published on Twitter to try to get the attention of Google. Apparently, they already begun attempting to remove questionable content to repair their reputation, Not sure that’s the best approach though...
