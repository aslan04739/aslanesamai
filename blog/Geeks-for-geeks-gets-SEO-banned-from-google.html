               <p>Google’s hammer has struck, and it hit hard… This might be the toughest penalty I’ve ever seen. GeeksForGeeks, once a go-to site for developers, SEOs, and more, has been deindexed by Google. The result? A complete loss of visibility. If you search for the site now, you won’t find it. There’s no trace of existence…

                  This sudden drop in visibility is a harsh reminder of how quickly and severely Google can impact even the most established sites.</p>
               <h2 class="custom-h2">Key Stats: The Decline in Numbers
               </h2>
               <p>In the first quarter of the year (January to March), GeeksForGeeks saw an impressive 136.9 million visits, with 83% of that traffic coming from Google. Fast forward to April, and that number drops to zero. No traffic. Nothing.

                  It’s clear: when Google decides to strike, it doesn’t hold back. It’s swift, brutal, and leaves lasting consequences.</p>
                  <p>I personally find this fascinating. Google does not play. They might grant you the benefit of the doubt, but when they make sure you're trying to play them, they will knock you out.</p>
                  <P>What I like ti bear in mind is that they did this for GeeksForGeeks and previously Forbes. Huge actors in the web scene. Imagine what they would do to you and your tiny website... </P>
                  <h2>What Can SEs Learn from This Situation?
                  </h2>
                  <p>The first lesson here is that Google doesn’t hesitate to penalize sites that try to manipulate their reputation. The rules of the game apply to everyone — regardless of how large or established a site is. GeeksForGeeks, which was a respected source in the developer community, is now facing the full weight of Google’s penalty.

                     Interestingly, Forbes experienced a similar situation in the past (yes, Forbes was penalized too). Google isn’t sparing anyone, even when they’re industry giants.
                     
                     It’s also worth noting that Google emphasized the issue of reputation abuse during their most recent Google Search Central conference. This focus on maintaining trust and authority is something that can’t be overlooked in SEO today.</p>
                  
                  <h2>SEO learnings from GeeksForGeeks</h2>
                  <h3>Subdomains: A Double-Edged Sword</h3>
                  <p>One of the more interesting points to consider is how Google handles subdomains. Officially, Google treats subdomains as separate entities, meaning any issues on a subdomain shouldn’t necessarily affect the main domain.

                     However, the reality is a bit murkier. Spammy practices or bad SEO tactics on subdomains can spill over and impact the entire domain — including other subdomains. This is something site owners often overlook.
                     
                     In fact, there have been leaks from Google’s API suggesting that Google doesn’t always make a clear distinction between a primary domain and its subdomains. So, it’s important to be cautious when dealing with subdomains.</p>

                  <h3>The Culprit: Topical Drift</h3>
                  <p>So, what exactly went wrong with GeeksForGeeks?

                     The main issue appears to be “topical drift” — an issue that many websites face as they try to diversify content. GeeksForGeeks began expanding its focus beyond its core area of expertise in tech and development. They ventured into irrelevant topics such as birthday celebrations and Instagram tips.
                     
                     While diversification is key to growing a site, doing so without a clear strategy or without staying relevant to your core audience dilutes your authority. In this case, GeeksForGeeks shifted too far from its technical roots, weakening its perceived authority in the process.</p>
                  <h3>Site structure VS Global penalty</h3>
                  <P>Another key takeaway is the importance of having a solid site structure. GeeksForGeeks fell victim to this with its flat URL structure. A flat structure means there’s no clear hierarchy for search engines to follow, which can cause confusion and make it harder to prioritize content.

                     This lack of hierarchy could very well be one of the reasons Google imposed a global penalty on the entire site. As an SEO professional, I can’t stress enough how crucial site structure is. Proper structuring can improve crawl efficiency and give your site a much better chance of ranking higher.</P>  
                  <H2>SEO Takeaways: Lessons Learned from GeeksForGeeks’ Decline</H2>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Stay Focused on Your Core Topic: Expanding into new areas is great, but make sure they align with your core expertise. Randomly diversifying content just to capture more clicks or traffic can hurt your authority and affect your overall EEAT (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness).</li>
                     <li>Properly Structure Your URLs: A clean URL structure is essential for SEO. Using subdirectories or subdomains allows you to test new content without risking your entire domain’s rankings.</li>
                     <li>Treat Subdomains with Caution: If you’re planning to experiment with new content or approaches, consider using a completely separate domain. A subdomain is still a part of your main domain, and it can still impact your overall site performance.</li>
                     <li>Don’t Chase Clicks at the Expense of Quality: It’s tempting to expand your content pillars in an effort to capture more search traffic. But remember, quality always trumps quantity. Keep your content focused, relevant, and valuable to your audience.</li>
                  </ul>
               <h2>Wrapping up on the Geeks For Geeks SEO downfall</h2>
               <p>In conclusion, the GeeksForGeeks case serves as a wake-up call for all websites. SEO is a game of consistency and relevance. While trying to diversify and capture new audiences can be tempting, it’s important to stay true to your niche and maintain a clear, focused approach.

                  The site may be up and running, but it’s invisible to Google’s algorithms. The only thing left to do now is wait and see whether the site’s administrators can regain Google’s favor — a difficult task, but not impossible. Though it seems they’ve already begun attempting to remove questionable content to repair their reputation, I’m not sure that’s the best approach.
                  
                  Let’s hope they find their way back to relevance without losing their original identity in the process.
                  
                  
                  PS: The site is still online, but it’s invisible on Google.
                  
                  PSS: GeeksForGeeks’ webmasters seem to be aware of the problem and are trying to remove content to regain Google’s trust. But will this be enough to fix things?
