    <title>Google Retires FAQ and How-To Rich Results Display: Unveiling the Ramifications</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Good bye FAQ and Rich results, Good by my lover, good bye my friend...</h2>
  <p>Google just dropped a bombshell on SEOs, developers and content creators world wide. They said and I quote : "To provide a cleaner and more consistent search experience, we're changing how some rich results types are shown in Google's search results. In particular, we're reducing the visibility of FAQ rich results, and limiting How-To rich results to desktop devices. This change should finish rolling out globally within the next week."</p>
  <p>In a seismic shift that has sent shockwaves through the digital realm, Google's decision to restrict the display of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and How-To rich results for the majority of websites has shocked everyone. The announcement wad made yesterday but the repercussions are being felt already.</p>

  <h2>The Aftermath: A Traffic Decrease</h2>
  
  <p>One striking manifestation of this transformation can be witnessed in the form of website traffic shifts. Glenn Gabe, an authoritative voice in the SEO community, has shared compelling data that showcases a discernible decrease in website traffic for websites affected by the retirement of FAQ and How-To rich results. This decrease is attributed to the diminished visibility of these websites in search results—a testament to the significant role that rich results play in attracting users' attention and driving organic traffic.
  
  Gabe's observations underscore the pivotal role that FAQ and How-To rich results have played in elevating website visibility, driving engagement, and fostering an enhanced user experience. As these rich results take their final bow for the majority of websites, it's evident that the impact extends beyond theoretical implications—it's a real-world scenario that website owners and digital marketers must grapple with.
  
  Navigating the New Norm
  
  As website owners come to terms with this altered landscape, adapting strategies becomes paramount. While FAQ Schema rich results have been retired for most websites, this recalibration necessitates a renewed focus on crafting authoritative and comprehensive content. The onus is on website owners to ensure their content stands out as a reliable source of information, even without the crutch of FAQ rich results.</p>
  
  <p>For How-To content creators, the desktop-exclusive display and mobile markup requirement underscore the importance of mobile compatibility. This shift not only reiterates the value Google places on seamless user experiences but also encourages content creators to align their strategies with evolving user behavior. </p>

    <h2>Navigating the New Norm</h2>

    <p>That said, Glenn Gabe wasn't the only SEO professional to take notice of the changes.<a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-faq-howto-rich-results-less-35845.html">Search round table</a>, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-reduces-the-visibility-of-howto-and-faq-rich-results-in-search-430452">Search engine land</a>, and a bunch of SEOs on Twitter(Not gonna call it X) wrote about the changes. <a href="https://twitter.com/lilyraynyc/status/1689006438327500800?s=20">Here's a good Tweet from Lily Ray</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aleyda/status/1689014944614977536?s=20">another one from Aleyda Solis </a></p>
    <p> Needless to say that this one is a big one. And the full impact of less rich results and FAQ on the SERP are yet to be seen and felt.</p>
