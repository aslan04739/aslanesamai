                <h1>The Cookieless Future We’ve Been Promised Is Not Coming</h1>
                <p>Google has long touted a future of enhanced privacy—a world without cookies. The tech giant introduced several ambitious yet ultimately fruitless initiatives to replace cookies, including Privacy Sandbox, FLoC, and Topics (anyone remember those?).</p>
                <p>Throughout this saga, stakeholders such as advertisers, tech experts, and regulators like the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) have voiced strong objections, albeit for varied reasons.</p>
                <p>Google might’ve finally kneeled…</p>
                <h2>A Few Days Ago Though, News Broke About the Same Topic. And It’s Not What You Think…</h2>
                <p>Instead of a nudge from Google reminding us, once more, to prepare ourselves for the inevitable future, we got a shocking post announcing the death of the unbirthed calcified baby…</p>
                <h2>What Did Google Actually Say in the Blog Post?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>They have been facing backlash from everyone. For different reasons…</strong>
                        <p>Throughout this process… we’ve received feedback from a wide variety of stakeholders… This feedback has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>There was no middle ground</strong>
                        <p>We recognize this transition requires significant work by many participants and will have an impact on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Previous tests revealed concerning results</strong>
                        <p>According to Google, removing 3P cookies on their own would result in a 34% dip in programmatic revenue for advertisers using Ad Manager, and a 21% dip for those advertisers using AdSense. By enabling Privacy Sandbox APIs, revenues reportedly only dipped by 20% (Ad Manager) and 18% (AdSense).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Users will have the last word (à la Apple)</strong>
                        <p>We would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>What Does This Mean for SEOs, Marketers, and Advertisers?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>First of all, we can all sigh of relief. Or can we really?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>That aside, I won't go so far as to say we knew the cookieless future we were promised was never going to be a real thing. At least not how it was tooted.</strong> But after repeatedly missing the self-imposed deadlines Google put to loose the cookies (or at least come up with a viable alternative and start the transition), we had our doubts...</li>
                    <li><strong>The privacy trend. Pushed by Apple and backed by regulators isn’t going away anytime soon.</strong> Google, will, sooner or later have to come up with a more sustainable and satisfying solution to reassure everyone. Without putting at peril its business model.</li>
                    <li><strong>No one won the war. Yet…</strong> Google is still working on its SGE SERP. With ramifications to be seen...</li>
