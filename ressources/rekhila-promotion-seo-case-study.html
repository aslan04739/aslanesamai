                  <p>This SEO case study focuses on REKHILA Promotion, a real estate company based in Algiers with properties in numerous locations. REKHILA was a client I greatly enjoyed working with, especially because they approached me with a brand-new website. This situation made the work more straightforward and efficient, as you'll see.
                  </p> 
                  <p>However, working with a new website also comes with unique challenges.
                     New websites often face particular challenges in the realm of SEO:</p>    
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Indexing and Crawling Issues: Search engines need time to discover and index new pages.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Domain Authority: New websites often start with low or no domain authority, making it harder to rank.
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Content Creation and Optimization: Initial content needs to be high-quality, relevant, and optimized for target keywords.
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Building Backlinks: Establishing a network of quality backlinks is essential but can be difficult for new sites.
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Establishing User Trust: New websites must build credibility and trust with both users and search engines.
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Technical SEO Setup: Proper technical setup, including mobile-friendliness, site speed, and secure connections (HTTPS), is crucial.
                        </strong></li>
                     </ul>     
                     <p>Despite these challenges, working with REKHILA Promotion was a rewarding experience. Here’s what we found out during the audit and what we did to improve visibility. 
                        We implemented a comprehensive strategy that included keyword research, backlink analysis, content creation, technical improvements, and more. This case study highlights our step-by-step approach, the challenges we faced, and the outstanding results achieved, showcasing the power of a well-crafted SEO strategy. Join us as we dive into how REKHILA Promotion surpassed expectations and achieved significant growth through strategic SEO initiatives.</p>        
                  <h2>The SEO Problem</h2>
                  <p>
                     Most clients I work with have this issue : No google search console / No google analytics. 
                     Consequently, The site map hasn’t been submitted to GSC. Needless to say that Google didn’t even know the site existed. 
                     In addition to that, most pages were not indexed.</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Every single page on the website was missing H1 titles 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Every single page on the website was missing meta descriptions 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>The website has no blog (no content)
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>No structured was were added 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Images were served in jpg and png. Slowing down the site. 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Image had no alt text
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Orphan pages have been detected. 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Unexciting traffic 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Non descriptive URLs (<a href="https://rekhilapromotion.com/2024/02/15/">Example 1</a>, <a href="https://rekhilapromotion.com/2024/02/11/">Example 2</a>)
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>The website had no backlinks. 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Thin content : most content pages (event pages) had no more than 200 words per page. 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Duplicate pages with no canonical tags. 
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Pages with a (relatively) high click depth
                        </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Poor quality Backlinks (2 toxic backlinks)
                        </strong></li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>All of these problems had a technical component. That said, the bigger issue I faced was a lack of vision regarding SEO. The company had potential and the will to succeed, but they were completely unaware of what needed to be done to achieve high rankings and how to go about it.
                     </p>     
                     <p>As you may have noticed, REKHILA Promotion had many problems. Here’s what we did to improve site health and increase visibility. 	
                     </p>           
                     <h2>the SEO strategy</h2>  
                     <h3>SEO Competition</h3>
                     <p>My first step was finding the appropriate keywords for REKHILA Promotion. Having worked with real estate companies before, I knew exactly who there competitors were.  I pitched them to the REKHILA team and they validated them. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Here’s an example of the competition : 
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>Bessa Promotion</li>
                        <li>Aymen Promotion
                        </li>
                        <li>Sopimem
                        </li>
                        <li>Zebboudj Promotion Immobilière
                        </li>
                        <li>Tika Immobilier (no website)
                        </li>
                        <li>Promotion immobilière Aklil 2 (no website)
                        </li>
                        <li>Eurl Kerait (no website)
                        </li>
                        <li>Elmaklo Promotion Immobiliere 
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>Once I finished analyzing the competition, I visited their respective websites to examine their content strategies. I took detailed notes on their content pillars, which provided valuable insights for the next step in our SEO plan.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Content pillars
                     </h3>
                     <p>At first, I noticed that the website lacked a content strategy entirely. Needless to say, they had no content pillars for their (or lack thereof) SEO strategy. 
                     </p>
                     <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLatfMDScR6NercJmHfhgFzmtM09ptdfq_HO2JNueHg/edit?usp=sharing">Here are the content pillars I recommended</a>(they are in french because everything else is in French). 
                     </p>
                     <h3>Backlinks 
                     </h3>
                     <p>The site initially had three backlinks, two of which were toxic. We disavowed the toxic links to prevent any negative impact on the site's ranking. The third backlink was of good quality, so we retained it.
                     </p>
                     <p>After cleaning up the existing backlinks, we focused on acquiring new, high-quality backlinks <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPArm0KPiagso6eI9aW7BiWMcM5f4hK2kkGZQiqQcmQ/edit?usp=sharing">. I proposed several backlink opportunities and and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p5341aGie3-wy3fofn_B1BhFqoMTSIrOhmYryF9EdDE/edit?usp=sharing">developed a responsibility matrix to streamline the acquisition process and ensure accountability.</a>
                     </a>
                     </p>
                     <h3>Content creation 
                     </h3>
                     <p>For content creation, I relied on 3 aspects : 
                     </p>
                     <h4>Google Search Console Data
                     </h4>
                     <p>After setting up Google Search Console and allowing it to collect data, I analyzed the results to identify what content was performing well and what needed improvement.
                     </p>
                     <h4>Content Gap Analysis
                     </h4>
                     <p>With our focus keywords in hand, we conducted a content gap analysis to pinpoint missing areas. We started publishing new content weekly and monitored its performance to ensure it met our SEO objectives.
                     </p>
                     <h4>Industry Knowledge
                     </h4>
                     <p>Leveraging my previous knowledge of the real estate industry, I identified key trends and audience needs, creating relevant and valuable content. This combined approach significantly improved REKHILA Promotion's online presence and search engine rankings.
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the actual execution, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nOjRnIvXrCzv1MQo0Ur2c1otg-PoyS2G9m7XF4ZhsnE/edit?usp=sharing">we followed the following matrix of responsibility. </a>
                     </p>
                     <h3>Technical tweaks
                     </h3>
                     <ol>
                        <li>We set Google Search Console and Google Analytics.</li>
                        <li>We submitted the site map.</li>
                        <li>We labeled some pages as cornerstone.</li>
                        <li>We manually indexed the main pages.</li>
                        <li>We worked on implementing H1 titles and Meta descriptions.</li>
                        <li>We revised existing content and retired irrelevant pieces.</li>
                        <li>We added structured data for relevant pages.</li>
                        <li>We added open graph elements.</li>
                        <li>We worked on internal linking.</li>
                        <li>We converted images to webp and added alt text.</li>
                        <li>We created a blog section and added content pillars.</li>
                     </ol>
                     <p><strong>After a week, we started getting notifications from Google Search Console !

                     </strong></p>
                     <h3>FAQ</h3>
                     <p>We took a comprehensive approach to overhauling our FAQ page entirely, ensuring it became a valuable resource for our audience. We meticulously curated relevant questions, providing clear, concise answers to address common queries effectively. Additionally, we strategically incorporated internal links to other relevant pages on our site, enriching the user experience and promoting engagement.
                     </p>
                     <p>We implemented structured data markup tailored to the FAQ format to further enhance the page's visibility and relevance. This markup helped search engines understand the content better and display it more prominently in search results. We're pleased to report that Google promptly validated the structured data, affirming its effectiveness in improving the discoverability and performance of our FAQ page.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Review snippets 
                     </h3>
                     <p>Our SEO strategy integrated review snippets to showcase customer feedback in search results. By leveraging structured data markup, we highlighted testimonials on our site, leading to visible review snippets in search engine results. These snippets boost credibility and click-through rates, demonstrating our commitment to customer satisfaction.

                        There’s an SEO strategy for every business — including yours.
                        
                        Believing in the power of SEO made our work more manageable. But, not reaching out for SEO assistance right from the start stretched out our project unnecessarily. Looking back, we realized that involving an SEO expert from the get-go could have saved us a lot of time and effort.
