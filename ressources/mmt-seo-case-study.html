            <h2>The SEO problem</h2>
            <p>MMT faced significant challenges with its online visibility and website performance. The issues included:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Most clients I work with have this issue: No Google search console / no Google analytics. 
                  Consequently, The site map hasn’t been submitted to GSC. Needless to say, Google didn’t even know the site existed. 
                  In addition to that, most pages were not indexed. 
               </li>
               <li>The website was targeted by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELRdAOudtXoPpHuK-47romVRoNK7Kcii/view?usp=sharing">a malicious network of toxic backlinks.</a>
               </li>
               <li>WordPress and Yoast were serving archive pages and dated pages. These were deemed (quite rightfully so) as near duplicates.
               </li>
               <li>WordPress was serving RSS feeds(It Does it by default). These were shown in Google Search Console as pages with no-index tags. 
               </li>
               <li>The site is multilingual, offering content in both English and Arabic. However, the Arabic URLs were non-descriptive, leading to unoptimized SEO performance.
               </li>
               <li>The developer made many test pages and never bothered to delete them or unpublish them. This resulted in numerous 404 and 301 pages. 
               </li>
               <li>All pages across the site had multiple H1 titles
               </li>
               <li>All pages across the site had multiple meta-descriptions 
               </li>
               <li>Lorem ipsum content was found on the site
               </li>
               <li>No structured data has been detected
               </li>
               <li>Images were served in jpg and png. Without alt text. Slowing down the site. 
               </li>
               <li>Orphan pages have been detected. 
               </li>
               <li>The site structure had some issues (404 pages, orphan pages, non-consequential pages, etc)
               </li>
               <li>Unexciting traffic 
               </li>
               <li>Missing X default Href lang (for Arabic)
               </li>
               <li>The website had numerous irrelevant pages (template pages left behind)
               </li>
               <li>Internal linking was absent from the pages. 
               </li>
               <li>The website had no backlinks. 
               </li>
               <li>there was no keyword strategy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you may have noticed, MMT had many problems. Here’s what we did to improve site health and increase visibility. 	
            </p>
         </div>
         </section>
         <section>
            <div class="container">
               <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-lg-12">
                     <h2>The Strategy</h2>
                     <h3>Keywords</h3>
                     <p>My first step was finding the appropriate keywords for MMT. I knew the team. I started by doing some research on Google and found a few <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZJ6NeWD5-e2XT7HzsVNVRJR5oLFvcMU-/view?usp=sharing">competitors such as</a> : 	
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                        <li><a href="https://medicalcare4all.help">Medical Care4all</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://health-dar.com"></a>Health Dar</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.eshfaa.com"></a>Eshfaa
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="https://care.med.sa"></a>Care med
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>Once I wrapped up the keyword gap analysis, I exported the keyword data into a CSV file and dove into some number-crunching using SQL! Since there weren't a ton of keywords to work with, I gave myself the green light to aim for the high-relevance, high-difficulty ones. This approach helps us fine-tune our targeting efforts and hopefully boost our <a href="https://aslanesamai.com/blog/seo-games-for-beginners-in-2023.html">SEO game.</a></p>
                     <p>
                        From there, I proposed a few keywords I thought were relevant to the team.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Technical SEO:</h3>
                     <ol type="A">
                        <li>Optimizing and Adding Meta Descriptions: Prioritized starting with pillar pages to streamline the time-consuming task of adding meta descriptions.</li>
                        <li>Submitting a Sitemap on GSC: Implemented a sitemap submission on Google Search Console (GSC) to ensure better crawling and indexing.</li>
                        <li>Configuring GSC and Google Analytics: Recognized the value of reliable data from GSC for free, and configured both tools for improved analytics.</li>
                        <li>Addressing Crawled but Unindexed Pages: Manually submitted crucial pages like Home, About Us, and Pricing to Google Search Console.</li>
                        <li>WordPress and Plugin Updates: Ensured the WordPress version and plugins were up-to-date, and removed unused and conflicting plugins.</li>
                     </ol>
                     <h3>Off-page SEO:</h3>
                     <h4>backlinks</h4>
                     <p>We recognized the importance of cleaning up our backlink profile, so we took action to disallow those toxic backlinks using Google's Disavow Tool. By doing this, we ensured that these harmful links no longer negatively impacted our site's reputation and performance. It was a proactive step towards maintaining a healthy and trustworthy online presence.
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELRdAOudtXoPpHuK-47romVRoNK7Kcii/view?usp=sharing">Disavow toxic backlinks we found 
                           </a>

                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <h3>On-page SEO:</h3>
                     <h4>Content creation</h4>
                     <p>For content creation, I relied on two aspects : 
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>Google Search Console data: after setting up Google Search Console and giving it some time to collect data, I started doing some digging and found what Google was enjoying and not so much enjoying. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Content Gap Analysis: we already had focus keywords we knew we needed to focus on. We started publishing content once a week and monitoring it. 
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     <h4>Technical tweaks</h4>
                     <ul>
                        <li>The first thing I did was ask the team to change the LAN attribute to FR on all pages. It took a while but it had to be done.</li>
                        <li>Next, I started tinkering with Google Search Console. I submitted irrelevant pages to be removed. We fixed some 404s and we simply deleted some template pages that had no reason to be indexed.</li>
                        <li>From there, I tackled the discovered and crawled but unindexed pages on Google Search Console. I manually submitted the most important pages such as Home, About Us, services, etc.</li>
                        <li>Knowing Google Search Console has a daily limit, I took things slowly.</li>
                        <li>After some time, Google started finally indexing our pages.</li>
                        <li>By nature, MMT has many similar pages with the same content and different titles that they created to appeal to many targets. Sadly, these pages were seen by Google as duplicated pages so I asked the team to put canonical tags to signal the original page.</li>
                        <li>In a similar vein, most pages had no meta descriptions or irrelevant ones. So I worked with the team to add proper meta tags. Even though I knew Google often changes them.</li>
                        <li>Another thing I tried to improve was the images. Most of them were served as png or jpg and had no alt text. I tried to convince the team to convert them to webp. To no avail… So I just added alt text to them and called it a win (:.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <h4>structured data</h4>
                     <p>We also implemented structured data wherever it was relevant to enhance our website's visibility and performance. This structured data provided search engines like Google with valuable information about our content, making it easier for them to understand and index our site. We're pleased to share that Google validated the structured data, confirming its effectiveness in improving our site's presence in search results.
                     </p>
                     <h4>FAQ page</h4>
                     <p>We took a comprehensive approach to overhauling our FAQ page entirely, ensuring it became a valuable resource for our audience. We meticulously curated relevant questions, providing clear and concise answers to address common queries effectively. Additionally, we strategically incorporated internal links to other relevant pages on our site, enriching the user experience and promoting engagement.
                     </p>
                     <p>To further enhance the page's visibility and relevance, we implemented structured data markup tailored to the FAQ format. This markup helped search engines understand the content better and display it more prominently in search results. We're pleased to report that Google promptly validated the structured data, affirming its effectiveness in improving the discoverability and performance of our FAQ page.
                     </p>
                     <h4>Review snippets</h4>
                     <p>In our SEO strategy, we integrated review snippets to showcase customer feedback in search results. By leveraging structured data markup, we highlighted testimonials on our site, leading to visible review snippets in search engine results. These snippets boost credibility and click-through rates, demonstrating our commitment to customer satisfaction.
                     </p>
                     
                     <h2>Results</h2>
                     <p>As of now, we're still in the process of fine-tuning our website, but we're already starting to see some promising results.

                     <p>Believing in the power of SEO definitely made our work more manageable. But, not reaching out for SEO assistance right from the start stretched out our project unnecessarily. Looking back, we realized that involving an SEO expert from the get-go could have saved us a lot of time and effort.
                     </p>        
                     <p>For anyone going through a similar situation, my advice is straightforward: don't underestimate SEO's impact. Consider getting an SEO professional on board early in your project. It's a smart move that can make your journey smoother and more effective.
