                        <p><a href="https://rekhilapromotion.com/">At MMT</a>, a Mobile Medical Team company based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, we took on the exciting challenge of helping a new startup find its place in a competitive market. The site had numerous technical SEO issues, and the competition was fierce. But with a strategic, heartfelt approach, we turned these challenges into opportunities. This case study is not just a story of technical achievements but a testament to how dedication, expertise, and a personal touch can transform a brand's online presence, making MMT a trusted name in their field.</p>
                        <p>Established websites face the daunting task of staying ahead in a constantly evolving digital landscape:</p>

                           <div class="card-body">
                              <p>When we first audited the client's website, we discovered a range of critical issues hindering its performance:</p>
                              <p>Our initial audit revealed several critical issues:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li><strong>Lack of Google Search Console and Google Analytics:</strong> Without these essential tools, the site map hadn't been submitted, meaning Google was unaware of the site's existence. Consequently, most pages were not indexed.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Toxic Backlinks:</strong> The site was targeted by a malicious network, impacting its credibility and ranking.</li>
                                 <li><strong>WordPress and Yoast Configuration Issues:</strong> Archive and dated pages were being served as near duplicates. Additionally, RSS feeds were incorrectly set to no-index in Google Search Console.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Multilingual SEO Challenges:</strong> The site offered content in both English and Arabic, but the Arabic URLs were non-descriptive, leading to poor SEO performance.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Developer Oversights:</strong> Numerous test pages were left live, resulting in a plethora of 404 and 301 errors.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Improper Use of Headers and Meta Descriptions:</strong> Pages across the site had multiple H1 titles and meta descriptions, confusing search engines.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Placeholder Content:</strong> "Lorem ipsum" filler text was found, reducing the site's professionalism.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Lack of Structured Data:</strong> No structured data was detected, missing out on enhanced search listings.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Image Optimization Issues:</strong> Images were served in JPG and PNG formats without alt text, slowing down the site.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Orphan Pages:</strong> Pages without any internal links were found, making them hard to discover by users and search engines.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Site Structure Problems:</strong> The site had numerous issues, including 404 errors, orphan pages, and non-consequential pages, leading to poor navigation.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Unexciting Traffic:</strong> The site failed to attract and retain visitors due to its various issues.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Missing Href Lang Attributes:</strong> Arabic pages lacked the X-default Href Lang tag, affecting multilingual SEO.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Irrelevant Pages:</strong> Template and irrelevant pages were left behind, cluttering the site.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Absence of Internal Linking:</strong> The site had no internal linking, which is crucial for SEO and user experience.</li>
                                 <li><strong>No Backlinks:</strong> The site lacked backlinks, essential for building domain authority.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>These findings provided a comprehensive understanding of the challenges at hand, paving the way for a targeted and effective SEO strategy to transform the site’s performance and visibility.</p>

                        <p>Despite these challenges, our work with MMT (Mobile Medical Team) was highly rewarding. Here’s an overview of the issues we encountered and the solutions we implemented to enhance their online presence:</p>
                        <h2>SEO Strategy and Execution</h2>
                        <p>To address these issues, we implemented a comprehensive strategy:</p>
                        <div class="card">
                           <div class="card-header">
                              Key SEO Strategies
                           </div>
                           <div>
                              <h3>SEO competitors</h3>
                              <p>My first step was finding the appropriate keywords for MMT. I knew the team. I started by doing some research on Google and found a few <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZJ6NeWD5-e2XT7HzsVNVRJR5oLFvcMU-/view?usp=sharing">SEO SERP competitors</a>courtesy of <a href="https://www.semrush.com/">semrush</a>: 	
                              </p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li><a href="https://medicalcare4all.help" target="_blank">Medical Care4all</a></li>
                                 <li><a href="https://health-dar.com" target="_blank">Health Dar</a></li>
                                 <li><a href="https://www.eshfaa.com" target="_blank">Eshfaa</a></li>
                                 <li><a href="https://care.med.sa" target="_blank">Care Med</a></li>
                             </ul>          
                             <p>Once I wrapped up the keyword gap analysis, I exported the keyword data into a CSV file and dove into some number-crunching using SQL! Since there weren't a ton of keywords to work with, I gave myself the green light to aim for the high-relevance, high-difficulty ones. This approach helps us fine-tune our targeting efforts and hopefully boost our SEO game.
                           </p>

                              <h3>Backlinks</h3>
                              <p>We recognized the importance of cleaning up our backlink profile, so we took action to disallow those toxic backlinks using Google's Disavow Tool. By doing this, we ensured that these harmful links no longer negatively impacted our site's reputation and performance. It was a proactive step towards maintaining a healthy and trustworthy online presence.

                                 <li><strong>Content Gap Analysis:</strong>we already had focus keywords we knew we needed to focus on. We started publishing content once a week and monitoring it.
