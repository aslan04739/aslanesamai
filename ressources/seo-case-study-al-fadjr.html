                              <p>One of the first and most crucial steps we took was setting up an SSL certificate for Al Fadjr. This converted all HTTP pages to HTTPS, significantly improving the site's security and accessibility. Previously, users received notifications from Google indicating that the site was not secure, which deterred many readers. With the SSL certificate in place, these warnings disappeared, and the site became fully accessible to readers.
                              </p>
                              <h3>Creating a 200 OK Sitemap

                              <p>Given the size of the site, creating a comprehensive sitemap was essential. Using Screaming Frog, we generated a 200 OK sitemap. This process was time-consuming due to the extensive number of pages, but it was necessary to ensure that Google could crawl and index the site efficiently.
                              </p>

                              <p>Al Fadjr had a lot of quality content, but much of it was irrelevant due to the nature of a news site where timely content is key. Initially, we manually controlled the indexing process, ensuring only the most important pages were indexed. Once all pages were converted to HTTPS, Google started to trust the site more.

                              <p>There's an SEO strategy for every business — including yours.
                                 Often, due to past experiences or misconceptions, business owners feel their company is the exception. They might think their field is too competitive, or they're targeting a particularly unique audience. They may also believe SEO is too expensive to compete effectively.
                                 Al Fadjr initially fell into these traps — but it wasn't entirely their fault! They were told SEO was "magic" and all about optimizations, not content. When that didn't work, past agencies gave up, saying SEO wasn't for them.
                                 We proved that wrong.
                                 A couple of months later, Al Fadjr has increased their traffic, and it's still climbing.
                                 All it takes for your business to find success is the right strategy, targeting the right keywords, and creating the right content. To do that, you need the right SEO partner.
