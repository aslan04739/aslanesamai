                  <p>This SEO case study focuses on Unimind, a chrome extension that Nazim Zidi, the guy behind it, built for himself initially. After some positive feedback and genuine curiosity from his entourage, he thought the quirky minimalistic productivity extension might stand a chance with Chrome extensions users. So we set out to find out.</p>
                  <P>Unlike InterFast which was a more established company, Unimind was a completely new product. So new the team didn't even have a website. That was our starting point>
                  <p>First, we needed a website. Or rather a landing page we could redirect skeptics and curious users to. That and the fact the a website was mandatory for chrome extensions (or was it not, now I think of it, I don't think it was), drove us to explore our possibilities. We could've built a website from scratch but that would've taken so much time. That and the fact that we were at an MVP stage made a no code tools a more suitable option.</p>
                  <p>Now we knew we were going for a no code tool, we started looking for a platform that would work best for us. Nazim and his previous team previously used Web-flow. So we thought that would be a nice place to start looking. We tried Web flow and it was okay functionality wise. So we validated the platform and started working on the UX and the UI of the website. At the same time(not exactly, you know...) Web-flow announced they were going to raise their prices. Being a small team with limited funds, we decided the new offers were not suitable for us anymore. So we went out on a hunt for the second perfect no code platform(Or was it ?). </p>
                  <p>This time though, we didn't want to spend too much time comparing solutions. All we needed was a landing page after all. So we went with Wordpress. You really can't go wrong with wordpress...</p>
                  <P>The overall design was ready, we had a platform. All that was left were some design touches that needed to be finished by our graphic designer</P>
                  <p>Once I had everything ready, I started working on the website. Wordpress being wordpress, it didn't take me much time to have a landing page up and running. As of writing this, the website is still online. <a href="https://unimind.team/">Check it out here.</a> </p>

                     <h2>The Strategy</h2>
                     <h3>Competition</h3>
                     <p> Finding competitors or things that were doing things in the same vein of Unimind was not difficult. I didn't even have to use tools like Semrush or Ahrefs to pin point them because I was a productivity geek myself. To be honest, that made the task at hand less time consuming. That said, some of the most popular tools that were doing (give or take) the same thing as Unimind and by extension attracting the kind of audience we were looking for were X, Y, Z....</p>
                     <p>I knew these tools and apps before, but I was sure I couldn't have tried them all. So I run Semrush to get more references. And I did. Which was insightful both on a personal level and a meta level (got that one ? SEO, meta... But I digress)</p>
                     <h3>Keywords</h3>
                     <p>Being a target audience helped here as well, having been there already, I had some queries on my mind. Leaving it there though would've been an SEO sacrilege. So I used Semrush (My go to tool for all things SEO), and other tools like Keywords everywhere, keywords.io, also asked, etc to get a holistic view of keywords, long tail and short tail that people were using</p>
                     <h3>Backlinks</h3>
                     <p>Backlinks are one of the three pillars of SEO. But they are crucial for tools, app and what have you. I knew I had to get backlinks as soon as possible</p>
                     <P>To do so, we took the traditional route of doing outreach to productivity influencers on Instagram, TikTok, etc.</P>
                     <p>Being newcomers though (and frankly lacking a well rounded product) made people we contacted reluctant to say the least. But that wasn't going to stop us. Instead of waiting for our target audience to find us, I worked with the team on going and actively looking for our users where they hand. Online. Specifically, on Reddit, Discord, Twitter, etc.</p>
                     <P>Being a productivity aficionado myself, I knew exactly where to dig. I had some subreddits on my mind, but I can't deny I also relied on this Subreddit search engine...</P>
                     <P>In addition to subreddits, I searched for discord communities and found some interesting ones that fitted our target description</P>
                     <P>Finally, tools and apps often have specific platforms and websites that compare them. These tool aggregators and testers often give backlinks. They also have high domain authority. Which is a plus.</P>
                     <h3>Content Creation</h3>
                     <P>Content creation is a must when it comes to SEO. And we weren't going to leave it out. So we agreed on some blog articles (we made SEO driven decisions) and worked on putting them online. Once we shared them on our blog section, we reshared them on other platforms such as medium, etc. I added canonical tags to each piece I reshared on Medium to avoid duplicate content.</P>
                     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                     <p>In wrapping up this SEO case study, I want to share where we stand at the moment. I, as the SEO specialist, had the privilege to work on promoting Unimind, a unique Chrome extension crafted by Nazim Zidi. Through a well-thought-out SEO strategy that covered competitor analysis, keyword research, backlink outreach, community engagement, and content creation, we managed to give Unimind an online presence.</p>
                     <p>However, it's worth mentioning that, as of the time I'm writing this, our promotional efforts have been temporarily paused. But here's the thing: Unimind is still available on the Chrome Extension Store, ready for users to discover and use.</p>
                      <p>This case study underscores the significance of a solid SEO strategy in building brand awareness and making innovative products like Unimind shine. Even though our active promotional efforts have taken a break, the work we've done sets Unimind on a path for potential success among users. SEO, when done right, has a lasting impact, and Unimind's journey is proof of that.</p>
