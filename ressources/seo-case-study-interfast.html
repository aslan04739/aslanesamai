		<p>This SEO case study focuses on InterFast, a software company targeting construction professionals. With an underperforming website and several SEO challenges, the company sought to improve its online visibility and attract the right audience. Despite time constraints and limited team support, we implemented a targeted strategy that included keyword research, backlink analysis, content creation, technical improvements, and more. The case study highlights the step-by-step approach, challenges faced, and the remarkable results achieved, showcasing the power of a well-crafted SEO strategy. Let's dive into how InterFast defied expectations and achieved remarkable growth through strategic SEO initiatives.
    </p>
    <h2>The Problem</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>Many 404 errors on the website</li>
        < img src = "" alt ="">
        <li>Language attribute set to EN (English) but content and target were French</li>
        <li>Presence of numerous irrelevant pages (template pages left behind)</li>
        <li>Articles and important pages like pricing and about us were not indexed</li>
        <li>Absence of internal linking on pages</li>
        <li>Pages had no or irrelevant meta descriptions</li>
        <li>Pages had no H1 titles</li>
        <li>Images had no alt text (some still don't)</li>
        <li>Images weren't served as next-gen pictures</li>
        <li>Site health was low</li>
        <li>No backlinks to the website</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Strategy</h2>
    <h3>Keywords</h3>
    <p>My first step was finding the appropriate keywords for InterFast. I knew the team positioned their product as a software for construction professionals. I made some research on Google and found a few competitors such as Vertioza, Obat, Axaunaut, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>After that, I conducted a keyword gap analysis to see what sort of keywords everything was aiming for. Once I had the list of keywords, I exported the data as csv, and crunched some numbers using SQL! I went for low KD (keyword difficulty) and average volume, as agreed with the team. 

     From there, I proposed a few keywords I thought were relevant to the team. </p>

    <h3>Backlinks</h3>
    <p>Keywords aside, I really believed that when it comes to SAAS SEO, backlinks from comparison websites were a must. So I worked on a backlink gap analysis with the same competitors. 


    The team didn’t want to pay for backlinks, so I went for organic backlink opportunities and provided them with a handpicked list.</p>

    <h3>Content Creation</h3>
    <p>Comparison pages are a big part of SAAS SEO; That’s why I started with working on blog posts in which I compare different softwares to InterFast. I made sure to do extensive research about the software I was “comparing” in order to signal EEAT to Google. 

     I also made sure to include listicles and straight-to-the-point content to prompt rich results. Lastly, I included tables to make the blog articles more readable.</p>

    <h3>Guest Posting</h3>
    <p>Guest posting was another tactic I used. The team had some contacts so we leveraged them to create helpful content for our common audiences.</p>

    <h3>Technical Tweaks</h3>
    <P>The first thing I did was asking the team to change the lan attribute to FR on all pages. It took a while but it had to be done. 

Next, I started tinkering with Google Search Console. I submitted irrelevant pages to be removed. We fixed some 404s and we simply deleted some template pages that had no reason to be indexed. 


From there, I tackled the discovered and crawled but unindexed pages on Google Search Console. I manually submitted the most important pages such as Home, about us, pricing, etc. 


Knowing Google Search Console has a daily limit, I took things quickly… 

After some time, Google started finally indexing our pages. 
By nature, InterFast has many similar pages with the same content and different titles that they created in order to appeal to many targets. Sadly, these pages were seen by Google as duplicated pages so I asked the team to put canonical tags to signal the original page

In a similar vein, most pages had no meta descriptions or irrelevant ones. So I worked with the team to add proper meta tags. Even though I knew Google often changes them. 

Another thing I tried to improve was images. Most of them were served as png or jpj and had no alt text. I tried to convince the team to convert them to webp. To no avail… So I just added alt text to them and called it a win (:


Another thing I did with the team of InterFast is exclude the team’s traffic from Google Analytics. I for one was visiting the website a lot (I worked on creating pages for them too). So I used this Google Chrome extension to avoid skewing results. I suggest you do the same or ask your developer to do it directly from Google Analytics. 
</P>

    <h2>The Results</h2>
    <p>InterFast's blog and website content led to significant additional traffic and growth. The strategy resulted in remarkable progress within a short term.</p>
